 Task001


1- environment installation -> PHP -> composer -> laravel

2- created the front and blade with the index page

3- imported the style sheet by the public folder, because importing directly from the 
css folder was giving an error

4- the same goes for the details page. I don't know why it wasn't working in the view folder

5- controllers created, and solved the class not found problem

6- configured routes
